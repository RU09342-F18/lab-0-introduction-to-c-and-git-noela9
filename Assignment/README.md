Lab Exercise 0: Introduction to C, Git, and the MSP430

To begin this lab, the math.h file was given on Github. I accessed this file by receiving it via a link from my lab instructor, Russell Trafford. The function "Math" was given in the header file and it was needed to be implented in the main file. If you look at my math.c file, I created it using a while loop that resets the function if the operator that is input by the user is not one of the bitwise operators. Depending on which operator is selected, the math function will select the proper function to be computed, and output the value. The operators that this function can do are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulation, bitwise and, bitwise or, bitewise xor, bitwise not, logical shift left, and logical shift right. The header file must be implemented in the c file for the math function to work with the program. All of the outputs of the values are placed into the second input to the math function.
